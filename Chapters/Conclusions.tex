\chapter{Conclusions}

*1. PSS labels can be predicted with a high accuracy using a neural model
*2. PSS signal may be useful for PP Attachment
*3. PSS may be useful for normalizing different domains and languages
*4. (a) future work - further assess PSS contribution to pp-att
(b) and to other preposition related tasks: translation, entity-relation extraction
(c) integrate with additional schemes both to facilitate a more complete scheme, and for joint-learning.
(d) further experiment with the cross lingual setting - better alignment, more data, multilingual embeddings
