  abstract = {In recent years, variants of a neural network architecture for statistical language modeling have been proposed and successfully applied, e.g. in the language modeling component of speech recognizers. The main advantage of these architectures is that they learn an embedding for words (or other symbols) in a continuous space that helps to smooth the language model and provide good generalization even when the number of training examples is insufficient. However, these models are extremely slow in comparison to the more commonly used n-gram models, both for training and recognition. As an alternative to an importance sampling method proposed to speed-up training, we introduce a hierarchical decomposition of the conditional probabilities that yields a speed-up of about 200 both during training and recognition. The hierarchical decomposition is a binary hierarchical clustering constrained by the prior knowledge extracted from the WordNet semantic hierarchy.},

    abstract = "Prepositional phrase (PP) attachment disambiguation is a known challenge in syntactic parsing. The lexical sparsity associated with PP attachments motivates research in word representations that can capture pertinent syntactic and semantic features of the word. One promising solution is to use word vectors induced from large amounts of raw text. However, state-of-the-art systems that employ such representations yield modest gains in PP attachment accuracy. In this paper, we show that word vector representations can yield significant PP attachment performance gains. This is achieved via a non-linear architecture that is discriminatively trained to maximize PP attachment accuracy. The architecture is initialized with word vectors trained from unlabeled data, and relearns those to maximize attachment accuracy. We obtain additional performance gains with alternative representations such as dependency-based word vectors. When tested on both English and Arabic datasets, our method outperforms both a strong SVM classifier and state-of-the-art parsers. For instance, we achieve 82.6{\%} PP attachment accuracy on Arabic, while the Turbo and Charniak self-trained parsers obtain 76.7{\%} and 80.8{\%} respectively.",

Instead, we embed semantic concepts (or synsets) as defined in WordNet and represent a word token in a particular context by estimating a distribution over relevant semantic concepts. We use the new, context-sensitive embeddings in a model for predicting prepositional phrase (PP) attachments and jointly learn the concept embeddings and model parameters. We show that using context-sensitive embeddings improves the accuracy of the PP attachment model by 5.4{\%} absolute points, which amounts to a 34.4{\%} relative reduction in errors.",

    abstract = { Work on prepositional phrase (PP) attachment resolution generally assumes that there is an oracle that provides the two hypothesized structures that we want to choose between. The information that there are two possible attachment sites and the information about the lexical heads of those phrases is usually extracted from gold-standard parse trees. We show that the performance of reattachment methods is higher with such an oracle than without. Because oracles are not available in NLP applications, this indicates that the current evaluation methodology for PP attachment does not produce realistic performance numbers. We argue that PP attachment should not be evaluated in isolation, but instead as an integral component of a parsing system, without using information from the gold-standard oracle. }

    Abstract = {We present a new family of subgradient methods that dynamically incorporate knowledge of the geometry of the data observed in earlier iterations to perform more informative gradient-based learning. Metaphorically, the adaptation allows us to find needles in haystacks in the form of very predictive but rarely seen features. Our paradigm stems from recent advances in stochastic optimization and online learning which employ proximal functions to control the gradient steps of the algorithm. We describe and analyze an apparatus for adaptively modifying the proximal function, which significantly simplifies setting a learning rate and results in regret guarantees that are provably as good as the best proximal function that can be chosen in hindsight. We give several efficient algorithms for empirical risk minimization problems with common and important regularization functions and domain constraints. We experimentally study our theoretical analysis and show that adaptive subgradient methods significantly outperform state-of-the-art, yet non-adaptive, subgradient algorithms.}
